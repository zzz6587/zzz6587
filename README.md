Grettings from HTX, Iâ€™m Zac Wallace. I am an early career data scientist. I've been enrolled in the OMSA program at GaTech PTE and am finishing up soon.

Some things I might say about myself in those awful group introductions:
- I play guitar. Used to obsess over classical. Now, I pretend to play jazz and usually just fall into jam band type stuff alla Snarky Puppy.
- I read overwhelmingly nonfiction and read some classic out of obligation.
- I used to write poet quiet a lot, and fairly well I'd say, and one day I'll start doing it again.
- I used to debate collegiate debate competitions, a fun politcal sciency nerd things.
